## DMB documentation

Hi, this is a comprehensive documentation of everything that I found out about DMBs so far from various sources (mostly Tobba and Somepotato, some reference from the ancient documentation of N3X15, and some personal experimentation).

This documentation is a total mess. Feel free to attempt to clean up in a PR.

The documentation was mostly tested with v507 and in some cases v509 DMBs of both the 16-bit and 32-bit variety. Therefore, it is safe to assume this documentation is outdated for v510 DMBs until otherwise specified.
